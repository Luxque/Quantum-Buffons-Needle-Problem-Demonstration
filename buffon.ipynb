    "Quantum computers promise numerous advantages, including quantum parallelism, quantum simulation, and quantum cryptography.\n",

    "The random positions and orientations of the needles are generated using a quantum computer, effectively simulating the experiment.\n",
    "The purpose of this work is not to accelerate the computation of $\\pi$, but rather to illustrate the quality of randomness obtainable from quantum processes and to highlight their potential in probabilistic simulations.\n",

    "### Buffon's Needle Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by introducing the context behind Buffon's Needle Problem.\n",
    "Consider a plane marked with evenly spaced horizontal parallel lines, separated by distance $D$.\n",
    "A set of needles, each of fixed length $l < D$, is randomly dropped onto the plane.\n",
    "Some needles will intersect (or cross) one of the lines, while others will land entirely in the blank spaces between the lines.\n",
    "If we let $N_{\\text{cross}}$ denote the number of needles that intersect a line and $N_{\\text{total}}$ the total number of needles thrown, then the ratio $\\frac{N_{\\text{cross}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$ converges, as the number of throws increases, to the true probability $\\mathbb{P}_{\\text{cross}}$ of a needle crossing a line.\n",
    "Consequently, the probability can be approximated by:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{P}_{\\text{cross}} \\approx \\frac{N_{\\text{cross}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} \\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us simplify the situation.\n",
    "We can remove all the lines on the plane except for two consecutive ones separated by distance $D$.\n",
    "Now place a needle between these lines with a random orientation $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at this problem from a different perspective.\n",
    "Instead of focusing on the two lines, imagine throwing a line segment of length $D$ and checking whether it lands on top of the needle.\n",
    "In this setting, the position (both horizontal and vertical) of the needle does not matter; only the vertical projection of the needle, denoted $y$, is relevant.\n",
    "By symmetry, it suffices to restrict the orientation to the range $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a line is thrown into the strip, the probability that it lands on the needle is $\\frac{y}{D}$.\n",
    "Since the vertical projection can be expressed in terms of the orientation, $y = l\\sin(\\theta)$, we have:\n",
    "$$P(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{D} = \\frac{l\\sin(\\theta)}{D} \\text{.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $P(\\theta)$ represents the conditional probability of a crossing given that the needle has orientation $\\theta$.\n",
    "However, in the actual experiment, the orientation $\\theta$ itself is random and uniformly distributed in $\\left[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$.\n",

    "Classical mechanics promised that every phenomenon could be predicted exactly if the initial conditions of the system were known with high precision.\n",
    "However, the advent of quantum mechanics challenged this deterministic view.\n",
    "According to the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum systems are fundamentally probabilistic; we can derive probabilities of outcomes with stochastic reasoning, but the actual result of a measurement cannot be determined in advance.\n",
    "This led some to speculate that there might exist hidden variables, unknown parameters that would restore determinism.\n",
    "The local hidden variables theory was proposed under the idea that if the hidden variables were known, the outcome of any quantum measurement could be predicted deterministically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, John Stewart Bell formalized this question and proposed an idea.\n",
    "He showed that any local hidden variable theory must satisfy certain constraints, known as Bell inequalities.\n",
    "However, continued experiments consistently showed that Bell inequalities do not hold, confirming that local hidden variables cannot fully explain quantum measurement outcomes.\n",
    "Since no alternative deterministic theory has been proposed, quantum randomness is considered genuine and fundamental, not merely a reflection of incomplete knowledge.\n",
    "Quantum computers leverage these quantum phenomena to encode and process information, enabling the generation of truly random numbers.\n",

    "In most quantum computing models, each qubit (quantum bit) is initially prepared in the standard state $\\ket{0}$.\n",
    "As the computation progresses over time, qubits are manipulated through a sequence of quantum gates, which create superpositions and enable interferences between possible computational paths.\n",
    "These operations allow the quantum system to explore multiple solutions simultaneously.\n",
    "At the end of the computation, each qubit is measured, collapsing its quantum state to a classical bit (0 exclusively or 1).\n",

    "In both the classical and quantum simulations, the algorithm successfully approximated the value of $\\pi$.\n",
    "As the number of needle throws increased, the estimated value of $\\pi$ approached the true value, although some fluctuations were observed.\n",
    "These fluctuations are a natural consequence of the randomness inherent in the sampling process, whether it originates from classical pseudo-random number generation or quantum randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to these plots, both the classical and quantum simulations exhibit an overall downward trend in error, signifying that increasing the number of needle throws generally improves the approximation of $\\pi$.\n",
    "The classical simulation (Plot 1) reached an impressively low error, dipping below $10^{-7}$ near the end of the iterations.\n",
    "However, at the final stage, the error suddenly spiked to around $5.5 \\times 10^{-3}$, illustrating the inherent variability of probabilistic simulations.\n",
    "In contrast, the quantum simulation (Plot 2) achieved its lowest error peak earlier in the process, but ultimately stabilized at a higher error, about $10^{-2}$, which is less accurate compared to the classical result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these results can differ from trial to trial due to the stochastic nature of Buffon's Needle Problem, as well as the additional noise present in quantum computations.\n",
    "While the classical simulation benefits from deterministic hardware that minimizes numerical noise, quantum hardware is still subject to gate errors, decoherence, and sampling limitations, all of which can affect the convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration highlights the effectiveness of quantum randomness as a reliable source of truly random numbers.\n",
    "Quantum computers are capable of generating random binary strings, integers, and floating-point numbers, which can then be used in probabilistic simulations and computations.\n",
    "In this experiment, we used the random floating-point numbers generated by quantum hardware to simulate the positions ($\\hat{y}$) and orientations ($\\theta$) of the needles.\n",
    "The results show that even with a limited number of qubits and measurements, quantum-generated randomness is sufficient for modeling probabilistic systems, including Buffon's Needle Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these successes, there are some limitations when using quantum hardware for this type of algorithm.\n",
    "Real quantum devices are subject to errors caused by decoherence, gate imperfections, and readout noise, which can slightly distort the distribution of generated random numbers.\n",
    "Additionally, the convergence to a high-precision approximation of $\\pi$ is relatively slow.\n",
    "Therefore, while this demonstration is valuable for illustrating quantum randomness and its applications, it is not intended as a practical method for high-precision computation of $\\pi$."

    "In this demonstration, we explored Buffon's Needle Problem as a way to connect a classical probability problem with the emerging field of quantum computing.\n",
    "By generating random numbers through both classical pseudorandom methods and quantum hardware, we showed how quantum randomness could be directly applied to simulate probabilistic experiments.\n",
    "The results demonstrated that, as the number of needle throws increases, the estimated value of $\\pi$ approaches its true value, despite the fluctuations caused by inherent randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the algorithm is not an efficient method for approximating $\\pi$, the primary goal was not numerical precision but rather to highlight the power of randomness as a resource.\n",
    "In particular, the use of quantum hardware provided a unique perspective.\n",
    "Instead of relying on deterministic pseudorandom algorithms with fixed seeds, we could sample from nature's own indeterminacy.\n",
    "This reflects a fundamental shift from the deterministic worldview of classical mechanics toward the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the demonstration also revealed important limitations.\n",
    "Running quantum circuits on real hardware comes with several disadvantages, such as decoherence and noise, which can distort the uniform distribution of measurement outcomes.\n",
    "Moreover, free-tier access to quantum devices is restricted, which makes large-scale experiments impractical from the current standpoint.\n",
    "Nonetheless, even within these constraints, the demonstration successfully showed that quantum hardware can serve as a source of truly random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this demonstration bridges a classic probabilistic problem with modern quantum technology, providing an educational example of how quantum computers can be used to generate high-quality randomness for simulations and secure password generation.\n",
    "Beyond the specific case of Buffon's Needle Problem, the broader lesson is that quantum-generated randomness can enrich probabilistic methods and inspire new approaches to algorithm design.\n",
    "As quantum computing technology matures, such experiments may become more accessible and reliable, opening the door to richer explorations of classical problems with quantum tools.\n",
    "In this manner, the project not only offered a practical application of quantum randomness but also emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of quantum computing, linking mathematics, physics, and computer science into a unified framework."
